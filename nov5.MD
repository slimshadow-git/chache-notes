That sounds like a solid plan! Starting with a newspaper in the morning gives you a grounded perspective, while your afternoon social media and platform check-ins will help you catch any breaking developments or analysis. 

Since you’re already planning to use trusted UPSC-prep sites like Drishti IAS and Next IAS, here are a few tips for each platform to get the best out of your schedule:

1. **Newspaper (Morning)**: Focus on editorials and op-eds for IR and analysis-heavy articles. The *Indian Express*, *The Hindu*, and *The Economic Times* are known for their editorial sections, which are excellent for building analytical depth.

2. **X (Twitter)**: Use it to follow specific UPSC mentors and IR experts. Some UPSC candidates also create Twitter threads summarizing editorials or explaining complex issues, which can be a helpful supplement to your reading.

3. **Reddit**: Join subreddits like r/IndiaSpeaks, r/UPSC, and r/Geopolitics. These communities often share quality resources and study tips, and you can also find discussions that can deepen your understanding of current events.

4. **Dristi IAS, Next IAS, and YT**:
   - **Dristi IAS and Next IAS** both publish current affairs compilations, which will save you from information overload.
   - On **YouTube**, you can follow channels that give daily current affairs in a short format, especially around complex IR topics. Channels like **StudyIQ**, **Rau’s IAS**, and **Vision IAS** do a good job of summarizing key events with relevant analysis.

With this structure, you’ll have a consistent update flow without unnecessary scrolling. It’s also great that you’re capping this after the early evening, so you have time for other studies and a balanced lifestyle!
